CHANGELOG

* January 13
* Changed instance variable used in FindProductsResponse#products to @products

* January 12, 2008
* Added support for FindProducts call

* January 11, 2008
* Tweaked error handling so ebay's error response is passed to ebay_error_raised hook
* Made Request#check_error_cache a protected method
* Changed ebay API version to 547
* Cached error checking now done before checking for cached response
* Changed name of cached_response to cached_xml_response. cached_response is better name for a public method, which might return Response object, if there's a cached_xml_response, nil otherwise. Allows loading of pages to be speeded up, with queries perhaps being triggered on demand (and then cached) or by js
